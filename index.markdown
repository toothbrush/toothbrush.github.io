Hi!  I'm paul! üëã

None of what you read here is true.

  &ndash; A bit like the older side-project, this one is also best understood in the context of Flash Player and a very different state of the web 
  a decade or so ago.
  The extremely similarly-named project still exists on the web, but is defunct because of the endless treadmill of updated technologies
  and deprecated APIs.  One fine weekend, we said to ourselves that it'd be mighty fine to resurrect it, or at least something in the same spirit. Enjoy!

  &ndash; Check out Vistaserv, my latest silly side project.  It tries
  to be a super retro themed clone of Geocities, but with a few
  affordances of the modern web (such as no Shockwave or Java
  applets...)
