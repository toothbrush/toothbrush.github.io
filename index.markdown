Hi!  I'm paul! 👋 <strike>I'm a recent arrival to Melbourne, and i'm looking for software
development projects.</strike> I do <strike>Racket, Haskell,</strike> Lisp, pretty much anything
functional, but i will consider other options for food.  Before, i was a PhD student in computer
science at <a href="http://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/pwalt">INRIA Bordeaux</a>.  Earlier still, i was
an MSc student at <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/">Utrecht University</a>.  More
often than not my work these days involves Kubernetes, shell scripts, and infrastructure things.

  <strong><a href="https://www.vistaserv.net/">Vistaserv.net</a></strong>
  &ndash; Check out Vistaserv, my latest silly side project.  It tries
  to be a super retro themed clone of Geocities, but with a few
  affordances of the modern web (such as no Shockwave or Java
  applets...)
</p>

<p>On this site you'll find <strike>a list of my recent academic work</strike>,
    as well as <strike>pointers to slightly more off-topic things
    such as my hobbies</strike> &mdash; many are to be found online. There also
    used to be the soapbox, where i used to expound on issues that
    grabbed my attention. I tend to get wound up about privacy,
    feminism, animal rights, music, gender, etc.</p>
