Ingredients
-----------

-   1 tbsp olive oil (good stuff)
-   4 red onions, sliced into rings
-   1 tsp rosemary
-   4+ dried figs, sliced
-   125ml bouillon
-   80ml white wine vinegar
-   45g brown sugar


-   decadent salt & pepper
-   200g fettuccine (or tagliatelle), fresh preferably
-   100-250g soft goats' cheese, depending on nr. people
-   more olive oil and/or parmesan cheese for garnishing

Method
------

Combine oil, onion, rosemary, figs, bouillon, vinegar and sugar (i.e., all the
ingredients of the first group) in a heavy pan and bring to the boil. Cover
and allow to simmer for about 8-10 minutes, occasionally stirring.

When the onions are soft and caramelised, add salt and pepper to taste.
In the meantime, boil pasta in ample, salted water. Once done, stir into
onion mixture and serve in deep plates. Garnish with goats' cheese and
decadent olive oil, optionally garnishing with a bit of Parmesan cheese.
