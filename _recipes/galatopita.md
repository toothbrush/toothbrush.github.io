Ingredients
-----------

-   1 packet filodeeg (5 sheets)
-   1 cup sugar for syrup
-   1 and a half cup water for syrup
-   Pinch salt

Custard:

-   3 eggs
-   3 cups full milk
-   Half cup sugar
-   Half cup water
-   Maizena and flour (if you have no flour use maizeina only, but don't
    use only flour). Apparently you can also find semolina flour in
    Holland but I've never had any luck.
-   Pinch salt

<!-- -->

-   Tablespoon butter, melted (this is to brush filo tops before going
    into oven but not a trainsmash if you don't).

Grease an ovenproof dish. Preheat oven to 180 degrees

### Syrup

Bring to the boil 1 cup sugar in 1 and a half cup water and a pinch of
salt. Let boil 5 minutes and then let it cool.

### Filling

Bring 3 cups milk milk to boil in saucepan.

While that is happening quickly mix the half cup sugar with 1 level
dessertspoon maizena + 1 level dessertspoon flour and 3 eggs and a half
cup water. This is stirred into the milk as it comes to the boil to make
a thickish custard, if the custard is toooo thick add a bit more milk,
or use 1 less egg but you don't know that in advance until you see and
then you should make a note on the recipe for next time.

Leave custard to one side.

### Filo

Open the filo pastry and cut them in half so you have 10 smaller
squares.

Now fill each sheet of filo with a dollop of custard and roughly gather
it up into a pouch so you have points of pastry sticking up and place it
into a well greased baking dish. Do that with each sheet of pastry.

Place in oven to bake until golden brown, approx 10-20 minutes or so.

Pour the cold syrup over the hot pastry when it comes out of the oven.
