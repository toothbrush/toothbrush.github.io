Recipe is written to fit a 20cm flan pan. Measurements in _italics_ are for a 26cm pan.

Heat oven to 165ºC.

## Pastry

* 1 cup wholemeal flour _(1 1/3 cup)_
* 50g butter _(66g)_
* 1/2 cup water _(2/3 cup)_
* Salt
* Paprika
* Baking powder

1. Blend butter and water into flour.
1. Roll into a ball and place in the refrigerator for 5 minutes
1. Roll out and line a 20cm flan pan _(26 pan)_

(JJ note: Add salt, paprika and some baking powder. Rub the butter
into the flour and add water gradually until the mixture clings
together in a ball. Or to cheat, melt the butter and add to flour, mix
well then add water)

## Filling

* 3/4 cup grated cheese _(1 cup)_
* 1 clove garlic crush _(2 cloves)_
* 1/2 teaspoon salt _(bit more than 1/2 teaspoon)_
* 1 1/2 cups cooked brown rice _(2 cups)_
* 3/4 cup sour cream or yoghurt _(1 cup)_
* 1/2 teaspoon curry powder _(bit more than 1/2 teaspoon)_
* 1 small tomato _(2 tomatoes)_
* 1/2 bunch finely shredded silver beet _(2/3 – 3/4 of a 160g packet of spinach from Coles/Woolworths)_

1. Blend together cheese, sour cream/yoghurt, garlic, curry and salt
1. Mix with rice and silver beet/spinach
1. Pour filling into pastry and sprinkle with breadcrumbs and paprika
1. Slice tomato over top and bake for 45 minutes

(JJ note: If mixture needs loosening, use milk. Can use white rice
instead of brown. The suggestion of 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder is a
bit mingy. JJ buys English spinach but baby spinach is okay too)
