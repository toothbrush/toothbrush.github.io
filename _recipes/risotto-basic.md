### Ingredients:

-   ±1.1 litres stock
-   1 knob of butter
-   2 tablespoons olive oil
-   1 large onion, finely chopped
-   2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
-   ½ a head of celery, finely chopped
-   400g risotto rice
-   2 wine glasses of dry white wine

Later:

-   sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   70g butter
-   115g freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Ideas for vegetables:

-   mushrooms, sliced
-   spinach (either frozen or fresh and blanched)

### Method:

stage 1

Heat the stock. In a separate pan, heat the olive oil and butter, add
the onions, garlic and celery, and fry very slowly for about 15 minutes
without colouring. When the vegetables have softened, add the rice and
turn up the heat.

stage 2

The rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep stirring it. After a
minute it will look slightly translucent. Add the vermouth or wine and
keep stirring — it will smell fantastic. Any harsh alcohol flavours will
evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence.

stage 3

Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle
of hot stock and a good pinch of salt. Turn down the heat to a simmer so
the rice doesn’t cook too quickly on the outside. Keep adding ladlefuls
of stock, stirring and almost massaging the creamy starch out of the
rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next. This
will take around 15 minutes. Taste the rice — is it cooked? Carry on
adding stock until the rice is soft but with a slight bite. Don’t forget
to check the seasoning carefully. If you run out of stock before the
rice is cooked, add some boiling water. At this point you can also stir
in any vegetables you might want to add.

stage 4

Remove from the heat and add the butter and Parmesan. Stir well. Place a
lid on the pan and allow to sit for 2 minutes. This is the most
important part of making the perfect risotto, as this is when it becomes
outrageously creamy and oozy like it should be. Eat it as soon as
possible, while the risotto retains its beautiful texture.
