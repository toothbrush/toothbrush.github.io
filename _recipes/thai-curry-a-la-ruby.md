Ingredients
------------

- basmati rice

- green / thai curry paste
- 1 large onion, chopped
- block of tofu

- green beans, halved and topped-and-tailed
- butternut, washed and cubed (don't worry about peeling)

- tin of coconut cream
- 1 lime
- savoury soy sauce
- peanut oil, chilli flakes
- cashews


Method
---------

Marinate the diced tofu in soy sauce, peanut oil, and chilli flakes.

Boil the rice.  Cup or two.

Once the tofu has sufficiently marinated, fry it in peanut oil.  When
it's done, scoop it out and fry the chopped onion.  When the onion is
soft/fried, add the vegetables.  Stir-fry a bit.  Once a little
browned, add a few tablespoons of the green curry paste.  Fry and mix
about 30s-1min until fragrant, then add the coconut cream.  Squeeze
the juice of one lime in, and allow the mixture to simmer, covered,
until the butternut is ready to eat.  Perhaps add black pepper.

Serve on the rice, perhaps with sprinkled cashews.  Some chilli sauce
might be nice, too.  Enjoy!
