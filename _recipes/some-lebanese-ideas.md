## cauliflower with tahini + dukkah

Yeah just that.  Boil then fry some cauliflower (leaving the .. um
.. heads quite large) and smother in tahini and dust with dukkah
spice.  Can be served on a bed of moghrabieh cous cous (oily, perhaps capsicum
fried to death in oil and then douse the cous cous in that mixture?).
Serve with "wild cucumber". http://www.tasteofbeirut.com/lebanese-couscous-moghrabieh/

## pastry envelopes

fillo pastry ish envelopes with haloumi and feta with spring onion.
can be served with pomegranate molasses.

## salad

tomato and cucumber diced finely so as to make a dense salad, with
some shavings of cabbage, and "sun-dried yoghurt cheese" or perhaps
sub with strong feta.  Oregano, and insert large green olives, too.

## green beans

Saut√©ed green beans (top n tail and not too large) in garlic onion and
chili, with fresh tomato.

## ambition

OK this one i wouldn't know how to reproduce.

Pumpkin / wheat, round (deep?) fried things stuffed with fresh spinach
& onion.  On warm cabbage salad.  Served with ajvar.
