Makes 10 large or 18-20 small.

Ingredients
-----------

-   62.5g flour
-   37.5g margarine
-   2 large eggs
-   150ml water

Method
------

1.  Heat oven to 190 deg C.
2.  Place water and margarine to boil.
3.  When boiling, add flour all at once and stir until it forms a smooth
    mass, leaving the sides of the pan clean.
4.  Remove from stove and allow to cool for about five minutes or so.
5.  Beat in eggs, one at a time, and beat REALLY WELL. The mixture
    should look like very very thick cream.
6.  Beat \_really\_ well. This is most important and you cannot over
    beat this cake.
7.  For large eclairs, use a dessert spoon, for small ones a teaspoon,
    and put the spoonfuls onto a greased baking pan.
8.  Bake at 190 C for 35-40 minutes (large) or 30 minutes (small).
9.  DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN UNTIL THE BAKING TIME IS UP. Otherwise, the
    cakes will sink in.
10. Immediately you take them out the oven, make a slit in the side of
    each eclair to let the steam escape.
11. When cold, fill with whipped cream, slightly sweetened and flavoured
    with vanilla.
12. Cover top with chocolate icing.

### Icing

1.  Use about .5 cup of icing sugar and .25 cup of cocoa, a few spots of
    vanilla. Mix with lukewarm water until just thin enough to spread.

Note: If you make these the day before, do not store in a tin or they
will go soft.
