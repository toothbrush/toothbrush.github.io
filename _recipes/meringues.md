These are mainly for eating on their own. Good when sandwiched with whipped
cream.

-   Cream of tartar (wijnsteenzuur)
-   1 cup of castor sugar
-   white vinegar
-   boiling water
-   baking powder

Method
------

1 egg white beaten for 5 minutes, with a pinch salt and cream of tartar.
SLOWLY add 1 cup of castor sugar. Add 1 tsp white vinegar and 2 tbsp
boiling water. KEEP BEATING. Fold in 1 tsp baking powder. Preheat oven
to 120 C and when the meringues go in switch off. Leave for 2 hours (or
do as mom does: go to sleep). Pipe meringues onto grease-proof paper.
