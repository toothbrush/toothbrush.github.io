Ingredients
===========

- 4 eggs
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup soy sauce
- Â½ cup sake (cheap sake works fine)
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
- 2 scallions (about 2 ounces), trimmed and coarsely chopped (== chives slash spring onions)
- 1 ounce ginger, skin on, crushed


Method
======

Add all of the ingredients (minus the eggs) into a saucepan and bring
to a boil over high heat.

Remove from the heat and let the marinade come to room temperature.

Hard boiling Eggs
-----------------

Fill another saucepan with water and bring to a boil over high
heat. Lower the heat a little once it starts boiling.

Use a pushpin to gently open a small hole on the bottom of each egg
(the rounded side is the bottom, not the pointy side). This helps
loosen the egg white from the shell during cooking, making it easier
to peel.

Gently place the eggs in the boiling
water.

Set a timer for 6 minutes.

During the first 2 minutes: grab a chopstick
or a spoon and spin the eggs around in the saucepan for the entirety
of 2 minutes.

During minutes 3 to 6, stare lovingly at your boiling eggs.

Once your timer beeps, pour out the boiling water and run cool water
to cool the eggs. Peel.

Pour your marinade into a bowl along with your peeled eggs. Marinate
them in your fridge for up to 12 hours. The longer they marinate, the
more pronounced the soy sauce flavors.
