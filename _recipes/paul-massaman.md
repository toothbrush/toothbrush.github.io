## For the paste
* 5 red bird's-eye chillies
* 4 shallots, peeled and roughly chopped
* 2 lemongrass stalks, tough outer leaves removed, then roughly chopped
* 50g bunch coriander, leaves picked and set aside, stalks roughly chopped
* 100g (4.5 tbsp) smooth peanut butter
* 1.5 tsp ground cumin
* 0.75 tsp ground cinnamon
* 0.5 tsp ground cloves
* 1.5 tbsp galangal paste
* 1.5 tbsp tamarind paste
* 2.5 tsp sugar
* 1.5 tsp salt
* 100mL water

Serve with rice and/or flatbreads.

## For the curry
* 2 x 400ml tins coconut milk
* 400g aubergine, cut into 2cm x 2cm chunks
* 800g sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 3cm x 3cm chunks
* 1 handful dried coconut slices, to garnish - toasted

## Paste method

1. Blend everything to paste

## Method

1. Put a large pan for which you have a lid on a medium heat and, once
   hot, fry the paste, stirring constantly, for five minutes, until
   dark and glossy; take care it doesnâ€™t catch and burn.
1. Add the coconut milk little by little, stirring it into the paste
   as you go, then
1. Throw in the aubergine and bring the lot up to a bubble.
1. Add the sweet potato, cover the pot, turn down the heat to minumum
   and leave to cook for 20 minutes (or, preferably, an hour), until
   the aubergine has collapsed and the sweet potato is very tender.
   Stir occasionally.

## Coconut

While the curry is cooking, toast the coconut slices. Put a small
frying pan on a medium flame and, once hot, toast the coconut for a
couple of minutes, until golden brown on both sides, then tip out on
to a plate.

## Serving

1. Scatter coriander leaves and (optionally toasted) coconut slices.
