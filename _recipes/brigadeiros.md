Ingredients for brigadeiros
---------------------------

For one portion:

-   1 can of condensed milk;
-   4 (soup) spoonful of cocoa powder;
-   30-50g (one (soup) spoonful) of unsalted butter;
-   50g of "Chocolade cripsbolletjes".

You can use salted butter and it may enhance the flavor, depending on
your tastes.

Method
------

1.  Put everything in a pan large enough to give you room to mix it.
    Notice you might need to mix a little fast at the end, so relatively
    tall pans are preferable.
2.  Mix it with a wooden spoon until it is more or less homogeneous.
3.  Put the pan on low heat and keep mixing. Remember to clean up the
    edges and keep stirring the bottom so it doesn't stick/burn and
    don't stop stirring. At first it's going to soften a lot but after a
    while it's going to harden.
4.  Every now and then try to turn the pan so that you can check the
    bottom. When it is viscous enough for the mix to fall as a block and
    you can see small bubbles being formed at the bottom, it should be
    time to take out of the heat.
5.  Leave it to cool down on its own for some minutes and then it's
    ready to put on the fridge.
6.  Spread the "cripsbolletjes" on a soup plate.
7.  Spread some butter on your hands.
8.  With a spoon, take small portions from the pan and make small balls
    by rolling it against both of your hands.
9.  Spread it around on the soup plate so it gets the "cripsbolletjes".
10. Make another one after you notice you've eaten that one before
    showing anyone else.
11. Seriously, stop eating this as soon as you make them.
