Ingredients
-----------

- large onion, coarsely chopped
- roughly 4–6 fresh tomatoes
- fresh chili, optionally
- garlic, spices: black pepper, ground coriander seed, ground cumin,
  masala, chili powder.  Optionally herbs such as herbes de Provence
  are nice.
- curry paste (e.g. Patak)
- mango chutney, optionally
- around 300g of frozen spinach
- block of decent feta
- naan bread

Method
------

Heat some vegetable oil, fry chili.  Add curry paste, fry a bit, and
then the onions, chopped. When onions are sautéd/glassy, add coarsely
chopped tomatoes and reduce. Finally add spinach and melt / mix, not
forgetting the garlic and other spices/herbs/chutney at this
point. Now is a good time to stick the naan into the oven, and when
that's done, serve.  Sprinkle diced feta on top.  Serve and enjoy.
