# Barinder's chai

## Main ingredients

- 4 teaspoons of fennel seeds
- 5 cardamom pods, crushed with mortar and pestle
- 3 black cloves
- 5 black pepper corns, crushed
- half a stick of cinnamon
- half a teaspoon of ajwain
- the equivalent* of three teabags

(* I normally use loose-leaf tea. If using bags, I rip them open and
put the tea in the saucepan)

## Method

1. Boil three cups of water in a saucepan.
1. When boiling, put the main ingredients in, and let it boil for 4 minutes.
1. Put one and a half cups of milk in the saucepan (the more fat in the milk, the better), and bring to the boil.
1. When boiling, reduce heat and let it simmer for 4 minutes.
1. Put in sugar or honey as required.

## Notes

I tend to use less milk than this; but traditional chai has near equal
parts milk and water. I've just never managed to get it tasting good
when I do this myself, although my mum can do it. I also use honey.

This is a template -- you're going to have to experiment with it to
get it to the taste you like. Be careful with the cardamom and ajwain
-- too much of either, especially too much cardamon, makes the tea
very bitter. On the other hand, I find that liberal use of fennel
gives it a refreshing taste. You'll just have to experiment!
