Potatoes and cheese
===================

By: *yours truly*

### Ingredients :

-   bunch of potatoes
-   some broccoli
-   Â±80g parmigiana
-   more boring yellow cheese, grated
-   onion, garlic
-   red pepper

### Method :

1.  Slice the potatoes relatively thinly, boil.
2.  In the meantime, chop onion and clean/cut broccoli.
3.  Fry onions, and in the meantime:
    1.  Put together some roux, preferably with vegetable stock.
    2.  Add basil, pepper, and when the sauce is the right amount and
        consistency, the parmigiana and fried onion.

4.  When the potatoes are nearly ready, steam the broccoli a little (I
    usually just throw the broccoli on top of the potatoes for a short
    while).
5.  Now combine everything in a dish and stick the lot into the oven
    which you pre-heated. Oh yeah, sprinkle the grated cheese on top.

That's right, I forgot the red pepper. The idea was to chop it and stir
it into the roux as well. I'm sure it would be tasty.
