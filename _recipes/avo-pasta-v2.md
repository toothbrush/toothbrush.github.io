*done with Tim*

-   2-3 large ripe Avocado, pitted
-   1 fresh lemon from the garden, juiced + lemon zest to garnish
-   6+ garlic cloves, to taste
-   2 onioins
-   1/2 tsp salt, or to taste
-   proper olive oil
-   penne
-   mascarpone, perhaps
-   pile of fresh bird's eye chilis, or similar (i used like 9)
-   Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
-   block of parmesan

Method
------

Pour a whole bunch of olive oil in a wok thing (shocking amount) and warm.  Add chopped onion and chili.  In the meantime boil
water for the pasta.  Dice the avocados and chop the garlic.  When the onion is suitably saut√©d (not tooooo brown),
add the garlic and avo and kill the heat.  Good time to grind a bunch of black pepper in, too.  Stir around a bit.  Hopefully the pasta is done, too.  Add some pasta-water and the penne
and mix around.  Add the mascarpone too, if you want.

Serve with grated parmesan.
