Method
------

### Spices

Get a good heavy pot. If you have a casserole pot from la creuset, now
is the time to use it. Heat up some vegetable oil in the pot. Don’t be
stingy with the oil. I know it’s not healthy, but you can’t skimp on the
oil when you’re making a chili. Get it warm on a medium heat.

Add about two tablespoons of cumin to oil. Again, that may seem like a
lot but cumin is the key to getting that Southwest taste. If you can
find some pimenton, sprinkle some in. Throw in some chili powder,
preferably chipotle chili powder, maybe a teaspoon or so depending on
how spicy you want your chili to taste or how red you want it to look.

The spices will turn the oil a nice dark colour. Don’t be alarmed if
things get smoky at this stage - that’s perfectly normal.

### Frying onions

Now add chopped onions - lots of chopped onions. Sauté them for quite a
while so that they get nice and soft, maybe ten minutes or so.

This is the point where you can personalise the paste. I like to add
some dark chocolate. Break it up a bit before adding it, but it will
melt anyway.

You could also try brown sugar or maple syrup. They’re both good for
caramelising the onions and adding a nice dark colour.

Throw in some chopped garlic and chopped chili pepper. You might want to
deseed the chili pepper if you don’t want to add too much spice.

If you want to add some whiskey or beer, now’s the time. Splash it in
and cook it off.

### Vegetables

Now that you’ve got a good paste going, it’s time to use it to coat your
vegetables. Don’t go crazy with the number of different types of veg you
use. I tend to stick to just mushrooms and peppers, chopped into
bite-sized pieces. Stir them around, get them all covered in the paste
and let them cook like that for a while.

Once the veggies are nice and soft, throw in the chopped tomatoes. Turn
up the heat until the mixture starts to bubble, then turn the heat back
down again.

### Beans

Drain your tinned beans. You don’t have to use kidney beans. Pinto beans
or black beans are great too. Try using a mixture. Whatever beans you
choose, be sure to wash them first to reduce the *ahem* gaseous
side-effects.

Throw the beans into the pot. Get it all bubbling again and then turn
down the heat. Put the habeñero pepper (also called a scotch bonnet) in
the middle of the chili. Push it down to partly submerge it but don’t
mix it: you’ll need to remove it before serving. In the meantime, it
will be releasing its heat into the chili.

### Wait

And now you must be patient. The chili should simmer for at least an
hour or two, preferably longer. If you can, make it a day ahead of time,
it always tastes better after being reheated.
