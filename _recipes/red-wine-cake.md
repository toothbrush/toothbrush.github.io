Ingredients: Cake
-----------------

-   6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature
-   3/4 cup (179 grams) firmly packed dark brown sugar
-   1/4 cup (50 grams) white granulated sugar
-   1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature
-   3/4 cup (177 ml) red wine, any kind you like (I used Bedell First
    Crush Red, one of our North Fork favorites)
-   1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract
-   1 cup + 1 tablespoon (133 grams) all-purpose flour
-   1/2 cup (41 grams) Dutch cocoa powder
-   1/8 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
-   1/4 teaspoon table salt
-   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (this is a great place for that fancy
    Vietnamese stuff you stashed away)

Ingredients: Topping
--------------------

-   1/2 cup mascarpone cheese
-   1/2 cup (118 grams) chilled heavy or whipping cream
-   2 tablespoons (25 grams) granulated sugar
-   1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Method
------

### Cake

Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch
round cake pan with parchment, and either butter and lightly flour the
parchment and exposed sides of the pan, or spray the interior with a
nonstick spray. In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric
mixer, cream the butter until smooth. Add the sugars and beat until
fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and yolk and beat well, then the
red wine and vanilla. Don’t worry if the batter looks a little uneven.
Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and salt
together, right over your wet ingredients. Mix until 3/4 combined, then
fold the rest together with a rubber spatula. Spread batter in prepared
pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the
center comes out clean. The top of the cake should be shiny and smooth,
like a puddle of chocolate. Cool in pan on a rack for about 10 minutes,
then flip out of pan and cool the rest of the way on a cooling rack.
This cake keeps well at room temperature or in the fridge. It looks
pretty dusted with powdered sugar.

### Topping

Make the topping: Whip mascarpone, cream, sugar and vanilla together
until soft peaks form — don’t overwhip. Dollop generously on each slice
of cake. It can also be covered and refrigerated for up to 4 hours.
