Ingredients
-----------

- eggplant
- big tomatoes (real ones) to make nice round slices
- onion, garlic
- olive oil obviously
- feta
- olives
- fresh mint (and/or origano)
- topped off with breadcrumbs, parmesan and optionally pine nuts
- pepper, liberally

Method
------

Fry the onions and garlic till the onions are really soft -- that's
the bottom layer of your thing.

To prepare eggplant: put round slices of well-oiled eggplant on trays
and bake for about 25 minutes, after having oiled them on both sides.
You might also want to salt them beforehand and place heavy stuff on
them to get the juices out.

Slice up tomatoes and eggplants into discs, place a layer of eggplants
alternated with tomatoes, then a layer of feta/mint/olives crumbled
randomly in between each layer of tomato and eggplant.  Repeat until
your tomato and eggplant is finished.

The top layer is a mixture of breadcrumbs and olive oil with optional
pine nuts.  Parmesan is probably also a rather tasty addition.

Once constructed the whole thing should bake for about 60–70 minutes
at about 180°C.
