Ingredients
-----------

4 tortillas:

- 140g (1 cup) all-purpose flour
- 1.25g (1/4 tsp) salt
- 40g butter/vegetable shortening/lard
- 60g (1/4 cup) lukewarm water

Method
------

In mixing bowl, combine flour, salt and grease with hands. Slowly add lukewarm water and mix until
it can come together into a ball. Transfer to counter and knead for about 2—4 minutes, until smooth.

Divide dough into halves until you have 4 balls. Place on a floured sheet or board, cover with a
clean teatowel and let them rest for 30 minutes.

Heat your ungreased cast iron (or non-stick if you must) skillet over low heat (till surface of pan
is 150°C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball with a floured rolling pin, rotating 5
or 6 times until you get a 17cm round.

Place the tortilla in the already heated skillet. After 40 to 50 seconds, when there are brown
freckles on the bottom side and there are air bubbles puffed up all over the tortilla, flip
over. Cook for 40 to 50 seconds more, until the other side is freckled and the tortilla puffs up
even more.
