Ingredients
-----------

-   olive oil
-   2 cloves of garlic, peeled and finely sliced
-   a bunch of fresh basil, leaves picked, stalks finely chopped
-   2 x 400g tins good-quality plum tomatoes
-   1 butternut squash, peeled, deseeded and chopped into 2.5cm pieces
-   1 litre vegetable stock, preferably organic
-   sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   5 tablespoons of ricotta cheese
-   500g dried penne
-   a big handful of freshly grated Parmesan cheese
-   1 x 150g ball of mozzarella
-   a couple of sprigs of fresh sage, leaves picked

Method
------

Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6. Pour a couple of glugs of olive
oil into a large frying pan, add the garlic and basil stalks and fry for
a couple of minutes. Add your tomatoes to the pan, breaking them up with
a wooden spoon and bring to the boil. Drop in the chopped squash and
simmer for 30 minutes.

Check if the squash is cooked by inserting a knife into a piece of
squash, if it is not quite ready simmer for a further 10 minutes. Tear
up the basil leaves and sprinkle into the pan with some salt and pepper.
Stir in the ricotta and the stock.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, add the penne
and cook for a couple of minutes less than it says on the packet. Drain,
then toss with the sauce.

Rub a baking tray, ovenproof pan or earthenware dish with olive oil and
spoon in all the pasta and sauce. Tear over the ball of mozzarella and
top with the Parmesan. Rub the sage leaves with a little olive oil and
put on top.

Pop it into the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes or until golden
and bubbling. Serve with a crisp green salad (e.g. on a bed of rocket).

Tip: If you’re a chilli freak like me, try adding a chopped fresh chilli
to your tomato sauce.
