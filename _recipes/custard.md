1.  Bring the milk, cream and vanilla pod to simmering point slowly over
    a low heat.

    blended.
4.  Pour the hot milk and cream on to the eggs and sugar, whisking all
    the time with a balloon whisk.

7.  To keep hot, stand the jug in a pan of hot water and cover the top
    with cling film to prevent skin forming.
