"Make me a focaccia"

# Ingrediënts

## Before baking

Dough

*   olive oil (about 60g needed)
*   340g water, warm
*   8g salt
*   420g all-purpose flour
*   1 tablespoon instant yeast


Topping

* Italoherbs


# Method

1. Grease a flat baking tin, drizzle about 2 tablespoons (25g) of the
   olive oil in the base.
2. Combine 3 tablespoons (35g) olive oil with the dough ingredients,
   beat at high speed with an electric mixer for 60 seconds.
3. Scoop the batter into the pan, cover the pan, let it rise at room
   temperature for 60 minutes — it should be quite puffy, but not
   fragile-looking.
4. Preheat the oven to 190°C.

After 60 minutes:

1. Gently poke the dough all over with your index finger.  It is
   important not to use any other finger, this will ruin the focaccia.
2. Drizzle lightly with olive oil, and sprinkle with Italian herbs, if
   that's what you choose to do.
3. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
4. Remove it from the oven, wait 5 minutes, then turn it out of the
   pan onto a rack.  Serve warm or at room temperature.


## Something else you might consider


* Consider adding 1 cup of your cheese, diced or crumbled, to the
  dough once it's been kneaded for 60 seconds. Feta, diced cheddar or
  provolone, or coarsely grated/flakes of Parmesan are all excellent
  choices.
* To make with whole wheat flour, use 180g of whole wheat flour and
  230g all-purpose flour.
