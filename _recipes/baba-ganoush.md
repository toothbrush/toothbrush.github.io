### Ingredients

- 2 big eggplants
- 1 garlic (because too much garlic is too much garlic)
- lemon juice (preferably from a real lemonâ„¢ of course)
- tahini
- salt

### Method

1. With a gas stove, char/cook the washed eggplants over the open
   flame.  It'll take longer than you expect - but at one point or
   another they'll start looking and smelling smoky.

1. When they're sufficiently charred, stick them into a preheated oven
   at about 220C and bake them until they're collapsed and very soft.
   It's difficult to overcook them, and undercooked eggplant is blech.

1. Optionally remove them from the oven and cover with alufoil while
   they're cooling, to (supposedly) increase the smokiness).

1. In a stainless steel dish, add crushed garlic, some lemon juice to
   taste, and the eggplant innards.  You'll have to scrape off (try a
   fork) the black burnt bits leaving the slimy insides.  Mix and
   squish until it's a chunky but even consistency.  Add a tablespoon
   of tahini or two, to taste, to bind the mixture.  Perhaps add some
   of the saved "oil" from before.  You'll figure it out.
