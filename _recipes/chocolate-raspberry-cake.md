As seen in Graz:

chocolate cake: add raspberries (keeps the lot moist), serve with icing
sugar sprinkled on top (or whipped cream). Chocolate cake should be
fluffy, warm, and touching sticky.

We'll start by trying
[this](http://www.bestmoistchocolatecakerecipe.com/) recipe. ![Pretty
good stuff.](Choc-rasp.jpg "fig:Pretty good stuff.")

Ingredients
-----------

-   Frozen raspberries. Allow them to unfreeze in a bowl.
-   2 Cups Flour
-   2 Cups Sugar
-   ¾ Cup Hershey's Cocoa
-   2 Teaspoons Baking Soda
-   1 Teaspoon Baking Powder (Optional) This will make the cake rise
    just a little bit more than using the Baking Soda only.
-   2 Eggs (I use large eggs)
-   1 Teaspoon Salt
-   1 Cup Buttermilk
-   Note that you can freeze buttermilk so you have it to make another
    buttermilk chocolate cake recipe later.
-   1 Cup Mazola Vegetable Oil
-   1 ½ Teaspoons Vanilla Extract
-   1 Cup Boiling Water
-   You can use 1 Cup of strong coffee instead of the boiling water.
    Doing so intensifies the chocolate flavor. If you're making it for
    children you might want to stick with the boiling water.

Method
------

1.  Preheat Oven to 150° C (This is not a typo! This is a slow bake
    chocolate cake recipe.)
2.  Use Crisco Shortening to lightly grease and flour the 9 x 13 in.
    Baking Dish.
3.  Place all the ingredients except the cup of boiling water and the
    raspberries into a mixing bowl.
4.  Mix at medium or medium high speed. After about 1 minute add the 1
    cup of boiling water. Then continue to mix until all ingredients are
    blended and smooth.
5.  Fold in the raspberries (you might want to save some for on top. You
    might not).
6.  Pour into greased and floured baking dish
7.  Bake for 1 hr. (Cupcakes 22 - 23 min. Be sure to use cupcake
    liners.)
8.  Test by sticking in the middle with a knife. If it comes out
    clean... it's done! If not put it back in the oven for an additional
    5 minutes and then test again.
9.  Allow to cool.
