### Ingredients

- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1 big bunch of fresh basil
- 500 g ripe cherry tomatoes
- quality extra virgin olive oil
- 2 x 400 g tins of quality plum tomatoes
- 500 g stale quality bread

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 180ºC.

1. Peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves, finely slicing the stalks.

1. Prick the cherry tomatoes and place in a roasting tray, scatter
   over one of the sliced garlic cloves and a quarter of the basil
   leaves. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, sprinkle with sea salt
   and black pepper, toss to coat, then roast for 20 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large pan, add the remaining garlic and
   the basil stalks and fry for 1 minute.

1. Add tinned tomatoes, then add 1 tin of water. Bring to the boil,
   then reduce to a simmer for ±15 minutes.

1. Tear the bread up, mix well and season to taste. Tear in most of
   the remaining basil leaves and let the soup sit on a low heat for
   10 minutes.

1. By this time the roasted tomatoes will be done, with juice bursting
   out of their skins, so add them to the pan, including all juice,
   etc.

1. Give the soup a good stir – texture should be thick as porridge.
   Adjust it with water, if needed.

1. Remove from the heat, add 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil,
   and divide between your bowls. Serve with the remaining basil torn
   over the top.
