Ingredients
-----------

Tofu filling:

-   sherry
-   tabasco (chipotle, preferably)
-   tofu
-   cajun (= cayenne, chili, oregano)
-   wok and chili oil (optional)
-   soya sauce
-   balsamico vinegar

Rest of sauce / filling:

-   onion
-   garlic
-   bell peppers
-   mushrooms
-   sweetcorn
-   black beans / kidney beans
-   same cajun mixture

Also:

-   grated cheese
-   tortilla chips (รก la Doritos)

Method
------

First sort out the bottom layer, the tofu. The tofu should be in cubes.
Heat up the oils and fry the tofu, afterwards adding the spicing. Salt
shouldn't be necessary. Once this is done, spread out in an oven-proof
dish.

Next, fry the onions, then the mushrooms, etc in a logical order;
afterwards add the beans. One could also add sherry here. Place this
mixture on the tofu and cover with crisps and grated cheese. Garnish
with some pimento (the smokey stuff). Oven 'till the cheese is browned.

Profit. Great served with a fresh, ripe avocado.
