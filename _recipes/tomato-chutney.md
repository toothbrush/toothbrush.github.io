The tomato chutney is very easy:

* 2 small tomatoes, chopped (skin removed by pouring boiling water
  over them and letting them sit just a short while - the skins just
  slide off)
* 1 chopped onion, red if you’ve got
* 1 - 2 cloves garlic chopped/minced
* small piece of ginger, chopped
* about 1 tablespoon (or more if you like sweet) brown sugar
* 1 red chilli chopped, if you like
* ±3 cardamom seeds, optional (remove afterwards)
* half teaspoon paprika powder
* about 1/2 to 2/3 cup vinegar
* salt

Tip it all into a heavy-based saucepan and boil gently until thick
enough, could take up to an hour if the tomatoes were watery. Stir
frequently.


good luck!
