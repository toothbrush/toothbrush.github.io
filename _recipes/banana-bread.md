Banana-Coconut Bread (makes 1 loaf) adapted from [HomeBaking: the Artful
Mix of Flour and Traditions from Around the
World](http://www.amazon.com/Home-Baking-Artful-Traditions-Around/dp/1579651747/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/102-1204051-8624918?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1193227094&sr=8-2)

-   3 large, over-ripe bananas
-   2 cups all purpose flour
-   1/4 tsp cinnamon
-   1/2 tsp nutmeg
-   3/4 tsp baking soda
-   pinch of salt
-   4 ounces margarine, at room temperature
-   3/4 cup sugar
-   1/8 tsp vinegar (I used apple cider)
-   2 tbsp dark rum
-   1/2 cup unsweetened coconut
-   demerara or other coarse, raw sugar for sprinkling on top

Pre-heat the oven to 350 F. and butter a loaf pan. Whisk the flour,
spices, baking soda, and salt together in a small bowl. In a medium
bowl, cream the "butter" and sugar for several minutes. Add the rum and
vinegar and mix for another minute. Starting with the banana mixture,
add the banana and flour mixtures alternately, about a cup at a time. Do
not over mix. When the last cup of flour is barely incorporated, use a
spatula to fold the coconut in using several swift strokes. Scrape the
thick batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and sprinkle the top
generously and evenly with the demerara sugar.

Bake for 50-65 minutes, until the top is golden and a tooth pick comes
out cleanly. A 9x5 loaf pan will take less time to bake than an 8x4 pan.

Enjoy!
