Makes 2 dozen

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 cup unsalted butter
-   1/2 pound of phyllo dough
-   2 cups chopped pecans (actually should be pistachio?)
-   (1.5 tbsp cloves, whole -- omitted)
-   1.5 cups water
-   1.3 cup white sugar
-   1 cinnamon stick
-   1 cup honey

Method
------

1.  Preheat oven to 175 deg C
2.  Melt butter over low heat. Pout 2 tbsp of the butter into the bottom
    of a 13x9inch baking pan. Layer 3 sheets of the phyllo dough in the
    pan. Trim dough to fit.
3.  Sprinkle 2 tbsp of pecans over the phyllo dough
4.  Layer 3 more sheets of dough, brush generously with the melted
    butter, and sprinkle with 2 tbsp of the pecans. Continue dough -
    butter - pecan layers until pan is 3/4 full.
5.  With a sharp knife, score the phyllo dough to form diamonds. Press a
    clove at each end of the diamonds. Pour remaining butter over the
    dough.
6.  Bake 45 to 50 mins, until dough is golden brown.
7.  While dough is baking, combine the sugar, water and cinnamon stick
    in medium saucepan and bring to boil, stirring constantly. Simmer
    for 10 minutes.
8.  Add the honey and simmer for 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat and
    discard cinnamon stick.
9.  Pour honey mixture over hot baklava. Let cool on wire racks. Cut
    into diamonds.
