It's super easy!  Great for impressing colleagues!

# Cake

## Ingredients

- 135g desicated coconut
- 375mL fresh milk
- 200g fresh or frozen raspberries (i only had 170g fresh on hand)
- 300g caster sugar
- 225g self-raising flour (i substituted with 225g random flour + 2g salt and 13g baking powder)
- butter, to grease pan, then to serve (optional)

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180°C/160°C fan-forced
1. Line base of 21x11cm loaf tin with wax paper, butter and flour sides
1. Place all ingredients in bowl, mix with a whisk or wooden spoon to form a smooth batter (don't
   over-mix!)
1. Pour or spoon the batter into the tin and bake on the centre shelf of the oven for 1¼ hours or
   until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean.
1. Remove from the oven and rest in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out the cake onto a wire rack
   to cool completely. Cut into slices and serve plain or with butter.


# Ganache

Also super easy - do this while the cake is in the oven.

## Ingredients

- 60g of 70% chocolate
- 180g of 45% chocolate
- 160mL thickened cream (i used plain-old fresh full cream)
- (a pinch of coarse salt flakes has been recommended elsewhere - i forgot / didn't bother)

(i ended up with 250g total chocolate of a different composition and adjusted to 170g of cream
:shrug:)

## Method

1. Chop chocolate with serrated knife, place ready in a heat-proof bowl
1. Bring cream just to a boil over medium-high heat, then pour over chocolate (adding salt if you
   want)
1. **Let stand for 10 minutes without stirring**
1. Stir with a whisk until smooth and shiny
