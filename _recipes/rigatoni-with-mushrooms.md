Ingredients
-----------

- 3 1lb packages rigatoni or other big pasta of choice

For the béchamel:

- 1½ sticks butter
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 8 cups milk
- Freshly grated nutmeg

For the mushroom mixture:

- 3oz dried porcini mushrooms, soaked in 2 cups boiling water
- ¾ stick butter
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1½ cups parsley, chopped, plus more for decoration
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 3 fat cloves garlic, minced
- 1 lb 8oz mixed mushrooms, about 12 cups chopped
- ½ cup Amontillado sherry
- 2 cups Parmesan, freshly grated
- Fresh thyme for decoration

Directions
----------

You can make the béchamel in advance, as for the rigatoni al forno
above, as well as cooking the mushrooms, combining everything with the
freshly cooked pasta just as it goes into the oven.

Soak the porcini in the boiling water in a small bowl. In a saucepan,
melt the butter for the béchamel, and add the flour; cook gently to make
a roux and then – off the heat – whisk in the milk. Turn the heat back
on to medium, and stir the bechamel until it begins to thicken and come
to the boil. Let it bubble for about 5 minutes to get rid of the floury
taste. Take off the heat and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.

Preheat the oven to 400°F. Heat a third of the butter and all of the oil
for the mushrooms in a large wide pan. Drain the porcini, reserving the
liquid, and chop before adding to the pan with half of the chopped
parsley, the dried thyme and minced garlic. Stir for a couple of minutes
then melt the remaining butter in the same pan and add the chopped
mushrooms, stirring for about 5 minutes. The mushrooms will appear dry
at first but will eventually start to give off some liquid.

Add the porcini soaking liquid, which the mushrooms will largely absorb,
but keep stirring while adding the sherry and let it bubble away. Turn
off the heat when you have a bronzed, syrupy stew. Stir the mushroom
mixture into the bechamel and add half the Parmesan and the remaining
half of the chopped parsley.

Put a big pan of water on for the pasta, and when it boils, salt it
well. Cook the pasta until al dente, then drain and add to the mushroomy
white sauce, stirring as best you can to get the pasta covered.

Turn into a large roasting pan, of approx. 12¾ x 16½ inches. Sprinkle
over the remaining Parmesan and bake for 30 minutes or until the top
begins to turn golden in places.

When the pan comes out of the oven, sprinkle with some more chopped
parsley and some sprigs of fresh thyme.
