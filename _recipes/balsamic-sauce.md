Quick and easy yet tasty sauce, based on balsamic vinegar. Looks
decadent.

-   1 part balsamic vinegar
-   1 part honey
-   thyme (of course fresh if possible)
-   possibly some black pepper

Method:

-   boil the honey mixed up with the thyme for a short while (±3
    minutes?)
-   let the honey sit for quite a while (±30 minutes)
-   reheat the lot, add the vinegar
-   boil until reduced to ±1/3 of original volume
-   let mixture cool down (important, otherwise it remains watery)
