*source: Linde, with own inspiration. Serves 2.*

### Ingredients:

-   1 onion
-   1 red paprika
-   1 aubergine
-   1 courgette (or 2 small ones, preferably)
-   tin of chopped tomatoes
-   2 eggs
-   bit of garlic
-   salt, other currylike spicing
-   (brown) rice, boiled with some bay leaves and yellow powder stuff
-   pre-heated oven (Â±200 degrees)

### Method:

**Note:** this recipe has in the meantime been tried and found
scrumptious. Eat at the risk of forever disliking other dishes.

-   Better start with the rice. I added some bay leaves and the yellow
    powder stuff (yeah turmeric).
-   Heat up some oil a lot and add enough ground cumin. When hot, add
    diced eggplant and roast.
-   Also add diced onion, courgette, paprika, in roughly that order.
-   Now for some spice. I added (among others): salt (important), curry
    powder (Rajah hot and Pingo Doce brand...), paprika powder, parsley,
    cayenne pepper.
-   Toss in the tin of chopped tomatoes and mix/heat properly.
-   Turf all this into a dish, make two (or whatever seems right) holes
    and fill with raw eggs.
-   Place in the oven and wait. Interested to see if this turns out
    edible!
