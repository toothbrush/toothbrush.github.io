Ingredients
------------

*Para 4 pessoas*

- 2-4 eggs, whisked together, salt, pepper
- basmati rice
- spring onions
- 2 carrots
- garlic
- frozen peas
- savoury soy sauce
- peanut oil, chilli flakes
- cashews


Method
---------

Boil the rice.  Cup or two.  In the meantime:

Make the omelette: whisk the eggs together and add salt/pepper.  Heat
up some peanut oil in a wok / frying pan, then make a few (1-3?)
omelettes (keep them thinnish).

Chop up the spring onions and dice the carrots, then fry those in a
bunch of peanut oil for a while.  Don't forget the chilli flakes.  Add
soy sauce and fry some more.  After a while one can add frozen
peas. Yes.  Once that is sufficiently unraw, i guess one can place the
contents into a mixing bowl.

FInally, in Wok, err add cashews uhm, and the rice and perhaps fry a little bit. 

Combine. Eat. be happy. Egg.
