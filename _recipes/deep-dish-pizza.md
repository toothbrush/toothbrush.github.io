## Ingredients

* 3 and 1/4 cups (420g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
* 1/2 cup (60g) yellow cornmeal (we use polenta)
* 1 and 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 1 Tablespoon (12g) granulated sugar
* 2 and 1/4 teaspoons (7g) Red Star Platinum yeast (1 standard packet)
* 1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) slightly warm water
* 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, divided (1/4 cup melted, 1/4 cup softened to room temperature)
* olive oil for coating


## Method

1. Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, and yeast in bowl.  Give
   ingredients a quick toss. Add the warm water and 1/4 cup of melted
   butter. The warm water should be around 32Â°C. Make sure it is not
   very hot or it will kill the yeast.  Stir the dough ingredients
   until everything begins to be moistened ðŸ¤¤. Knead the dough until
   it is soft and supple and gently pulls away from the sides of the
   bowl, about 4-5 minutes. If the dough is too dry, beat in 1
   teaspoon of warm water. Alternatively, if it feels too soft, beat
   in 1 tablespoon of flour.

1. Remove the dough from the bowl and form into a ball. Lightly greaze
   a large mixing bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside,
   turning it around so that all sides of the dough are coated in the
   oil. Cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rise in
   a warm environment (e.g., heat the oven to 120Â°C, switch it off and
   put the bowl inside) for 1-2 hours or until double in size.

1. Once the dough is ready, lightly flour a large work surface.
   Gently punch down the dough and roll the dough into a large
   rectangle. Spread 1/4 cup of softened butter on top of the
   dough. Roll it up lengthwise. Cut the dough log in half. Form the
   two pieces of dough into balls and place back into your greased
   bowl. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rise in the
   refrigerator for 1 hour until they are puffy as you make the sauce.

# Sauce (tomato)

## Ingredients

### Sauce:

* 2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter
* 1 small onion, grated (pff) (about 1/3 cup)
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional, but recommended)
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* one crazy large can (794g) of crushed tomatoes
* 1/4 teaspoon fancypants sugar

### Toppings:

* one ball's worth of torn up (with one's monkey fingers) mozzarella cheese
* 1/2 cup (45g) grated Parmesan cheese
* optional: handful of pepperoni per pizza, 4 slices cooked and then crumbled bacon (2 per pizza)
* additional optional toppings: cooked and crumbled sausage, thinly sliced green peppers xor onions, sliced mushrooms (add enough to suit your tastes)


## Method

1. I want to say, just "cook the sauce".  But if you must, here's the
   original steps.

1. Place butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat and allow it to melt.

1. Once melted, add the grated onion, salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes.

1. Once the onion has slightly browned after about 5 minutes, add the
   garlic, tomatoes, and sugar.

1. Turn the heat down to low-medium and allow it to simmer until itâ€™s
   hearty, fragrant, and thick -- about 30 minutes.

1. You'll have about 2 and 1/2 cups of sauce at this point. If you
   have more than that, keep simmering until the amount has reduced.

1. Remove from heat and set aside until ready to be used.

1. Preheat oven to 220Â°C or 200 fan-forced.

# Finally

## Assembly

1. Roll dough into big circle, put into tin.

1. Fill each pizza with 1/2 of the cheese (about 2 cups per pizza
   (!)), then your toppings. On top of those optional toppings (nb a
   "topping" here is something _in_ the sauce ðŸ¤¯) is the sauce. Pour
   about 1 and 1/4 cups of sauce on top of each. Sprinkle each with
   1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese.

1. Bake for 20-28 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.  One
   could cover the pizzas with aluminum foil after 15 minutes to
   prevent any heavy browning and uneven baking. Remove the pizzas
   from the oven and allow to cool in the pans for 10 minutes. After
   10 minutes, slice, admire, and discard.
