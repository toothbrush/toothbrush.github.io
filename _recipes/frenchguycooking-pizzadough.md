This is for **6 pizzas**, the dough freezes well.  To defrost, leave on
the bench for a few hours.

## Ingredients

* 1040 g Flour, Tipo 00
* 730 g Water (or ml)
* 32 g Salt
* 2 g Fresh Yeast *or* 0.5g Instant Yeast


## Method

1. In a big bowl, add some of the water.
1. Dissolve the salt.
1. Add 50 grams of flour and mix it well.
1. Add the yeast.
1. Add the rest of the water.
1. Gradually add the remaining flour.
1. Knead the dough for about 20 minutes or until smooth.
1. Cover and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature.
1. Divide it into six parts and form dough balls.
1. Let them rise in an airtight container for 6 hours.

At this point you could freeze them - in ziplock bags is convenient.

## Cooking

1. Preheat your oven to hot
2. Flour your working surface
3. For each ball of dough: turn out onto floured surface and use your
   fingers to flatten it out into a disc, leaving a bit of a tall rim
   for the crust
4. To stretch it, first put a flat hand in the middle, then stretch
   the edge out, fold it onto your hand, then flop it back.  Turn a
   quarter turn and repeat until you've done all the way around
5. Lift it on your fist and shuffle your hands around to let gravity
   stretch it out
6. Put it back down and do final stretching with amazing opposable
   thumbs and pinkies

Now top it with stuff, and stick it in your hottest oven for 5 ish
minutes.
