*This was inspired by my stint at FoE in Melbourne.  Presentation can
help an otherwise slightly boring dish :).*

Ingredients
-----------

- one bunch of kale, washed
- one butternut or pumpkin, washed
- garlic cloves, chopped
- dried chili, chopped
- mustard seeds, cumin
- ginger, stock

Garnishing:

- pumpkin seeds, baked in 220°C+ oven until golden

Tofu:

- extra firm tofu, diced, marinated in..
- soya sauce or tamari (and perhaps a sprinkling of salt)
- corn flour

Tahini sauce:

- tahini
- a few tablespoons of water
- ±1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 0.5 tsp or so salt

Method
------

Start by cleaning and chopping the butternut or pumpkin into cubes (i
leave the skin, because fuck the haters).  Take the bunch of kale and
coarsely chop it up.  Reserve some of the dark green leafy bits for
garnishing later.

Add a few tablespoons of fryable oil (rice bran, arachide, whatevs
man) to a pot, add lots of cumin (seeds or ground), the garlic, chili
and mustard seeds.  Fry/sauté lightly for a minute or two.  Add the
chopped vegetables and coat with spiced oil mixture.  When that's
done, add about 500mL to 1L of boiling water and a stock cube/powder.
Perhaps some ground ginger would be nice, too.  And ground coriander
seed.  Great, let it boil for 45 minutes or so until all vegetables
are soft and edible.

Shred the small amount of kale you kept separate **very finely**.

This is a good time to deal with the pumpkin pips and tofu.  A
sealable tupperware thing is nice for the tofu cubes, that way you can
shake it about to coat the pieces nicely.  After having marinated the
tofu in tamari for a while, sprinkle a tablespoon of corn flour on the
tofu, close and shake till homogenous.  Repeat about 3 times, or as
necessary, so the tofu cubes are covered in a gloopy sauce.  Heat up a
pan with arachide oil (only a quarter cm or so) and when hot fry the
tofu.

The tahini sauce is simple: take a few tbsp tahini (organic hulled
high-quality preferrably) and add some water and whip vigorously with
a fork till the consistency is pleasing (it'll go stiff and sticky
then yoghurtey).  Add salt to taste, plus a tbsp or so max of apple
cider vinegar (lemon juice doesn't cut it, i tried).  It'll taste like
yoghurt, great!

By now hopefully the soup will all be cooked.  Stir quite a bit with a
metal spoon or something: this will make it less watery and chunky,
and more creamy with a bit of vegetable every now and then.

Plate up!  Stick some soup in a bowl, put a bunch of fried tofu blocks
on, sprinkle pine nuts, add a dollop of kale-steel-wool, and
potentially drizzle some 'fauxgurt' dressing.  For bonus points, serve
with fancy sourdough/rye bread from your local free-range hipster
bakery.
