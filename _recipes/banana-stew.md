# Banana stew

### Ingredients

* 25g/1oz butter
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 onions, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon tumeric
* pinch of chilli powder or cayenne pepper
* 1 large green pepper, deseeded and chopped finely
* 2 tomatoes, peeled and chopped
* 6 bananas, peeled and chopped
* as many eggs as you like!
* optional parsley garnish

----> NB - to get the skin off tomatoes, cut a cross in their top and
drop them in boiling water for a minute, then place them in cold water
and the skin should come off easily. It's also possible to use canned
tomatoes I guess, but it'd be more watery.

### Method

- Heat butter and oil in a large frying pan, add onions, stir, cover
  and cook on low heat for Â±7 minutes.
- Stir in garlic for 2-3 minutes
- Add ginger, turmeric, chili or cayenne and cook for another minute
- Add pepper, tomatoes and banana to pan, stir well then cover and
  cook for 20 - 30 minutes, or until all the vegetables are
  tender. Season to taste.
- Spread mixture evenly in pan then make hollows to break your eggs in
  to.  Cover the pan and cook on low until the eggs are set, usually
  about 10-15 minutes.

We serve it with naan, chapatis, tortilla or roti depending on what we
have lying around. As I mentioned, we often eat half for dinner and
then have it again for brunch on the weekend.
