Sauce / Topping
===============

### Ingredients

for one tart

-   1 tart shell (see recipe: [Recipes:Tart
    shell](Recipes:Tart shell "wikilink"))
-   320ml cream
-   2 level tablespoons fine table sugar
-   pinch of salt
-   120g soft (room temperature) butter (= half cup)
-   450g dark chocolate of best quality
-   100ml cold milk
-   cocoa powder for garnishing

### Method

Place cream, sugar and a pinch of salt in a pan and bring to a boil. As
soon as the mixture has boiled, remove from the heat and add the butter
and chocolate. Stir until it has completely melted. Allow the mixture to
cool slightly. Add the cold milk and stir until mixture is smooth and
shiny. Sometimes this mixture looks like it has separated. Allow it to
cool down a bit more and whisk in a little extra cold milk until smooth.
Scrape all the mixture into the cooked and cooled pastry shell. Shake
the tart to even it out and allow it to cool for 1-2 hours until it is
at room temperature. Dust with the cocoa powder. Ultimately the pastry
should be short and crisp and the filling smooth and cut like butter.

Needs to rest a while in the fridge (1 hr plus), otherwise it will
remain runny.
