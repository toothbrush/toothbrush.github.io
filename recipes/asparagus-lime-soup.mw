== Ingredients ==

* Onions
* Butter
* Flour
* Lime for juice (be careful not to make it too sour)
* Vegetable stock
* Optional: white wine
* Asparagus bits (''As a bit of extra info you could define that the white bits of asparagus are the ends that you cut off from your beautiful mammoth spears and instead of throwing them away you make the soup.'' -- Mom)

== Method ==

Fry some chopped onions in butter, then when glassy make a roux with a tablespoon or two of flour (possibly some white wine if available). Next add a litre or so of vegetable bouillon, and allow to boil. Finally, add the chopped white asparagus bits, turn off the heat, cover, and let sit for 10-20 minutes.
