You'll Need
-----------

Sauce:

-   1½ tablespoons butter
-   1½ tablespoons flour
-   2 cups milk
-   ¼ teaspoons salt
-   1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg
-   1/3 cups finely grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano

Cannelloni:

-   3 tablespoons olive oil
-   8 fresh pasta rectangles / perhaps just dry, premade cannelloni
-   1 onion
-   2 finely chopped garlic cloves
-   10 oz baby spinach (285g)
-   1¾ cups ricotta (400ml)
-   1 large egg, lightly beaten
-   ½ cups chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
-   3 oz sliced prosciutto (85g)
-   ¼ teaspoons salt and pepper
-   ½ cups finely grated Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano

Instructions
------------

Sauce: Melt butter in a 1 ½- to 2-quart heavy saucepan over moderately
low heat. Whisk in flour and cook roux, whisking, 2 minutes. Add milk in
a stream, whisking, and bring to a boil over high heat, whisking
constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, 2 minutes,
then whisk in salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Remove from heat and whisk in
cheese, then cover pan.

Cannelloni: Heat oil in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot over moderately high
heat until hot but not smoking, then saute onion and garlic, stirring
occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and
sauté, stirring, until just wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat
and cool completely.

Stir together ricotta, egg, parsley, prosciutto, salt, pepper, and 1/3
cup cheese in a bowl, then stir in spinach mixture.

Preheat oven to 220°C.

Spread 2/3 cup sauce in buttered baking dish. Fill cannelloni with
spinach mixture, and place in the dish. Spread ½ cup more sauce over
cannelloni and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake, covered with foil,
in middle of oven until sauce is bubbling, about 20 minutes.

Turn on broiler.

Remove foil and broil cannelloni about 5 inches from heat until lightly
browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving. Reheat
remaining sauce and serve on the side.
