    red one

-   (1 1/2 pounds seitan, sliced 1/4 inch thick and patted dry) -- I
    added lentils to the potato stuff

    sliced 1/2 inch thick, and washed

-   1 pound cremini mushrooms, trimmed and quartered
-   3/4 pound carrots (about 4 medium), cut into 3/4-inch-thick pieces

    pieces)
-   2 tablespoons thyme leaves
-   1 tablespoon chopped rosemary
-   1 (250-ml) glass++ (used AH mini bottle shizzle) full-bodied red
    wine such as Burgundy or Côtes du Rhône
-   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
-   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
-   1 1/2 cups hot rich vegetable stock
-   1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley

For topping:

-   about 500-750g red potatoes
-   (3/4 pound celery root, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces)

Method
------

**Make stew:**

Heat the oil, softly let the onion rings simmer for a long time, in the
meantime chop the leeks and garlic.

/\*Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 5-quart heavy pot over medium-high heat
until it shimmers. Brown seitan in 3 batches, turning occasionally, 3 to
5 minutes (add 2 tablespoons oil between batches). Transfer to a
plate.\*/

Cook leeks until softened, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and cook,
stirring frequently, until golden and fragrant, about 2 minutes.

Add mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, covered, stirring
occasionally, until they just begin to give off liquid, about 5 minutes.
Add carrots, parsnips, thyme, and rosemary and cook, covered, stirring
occasionally, until vegetables are just tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
Transfer vegetables to a bowl.

Add (uh it's empty now right) wine to pot and boil until reduced to
about 1 cup, 10 to 15 minutes.

While wine reduces, make a beurre manié by stirring together butter and
flour in a small bowl to form a paste.

Add stock to wine and bring to a brisk simmer. Whisk in beurre manié,
then simmer, whisking occasionally, until thickened slightly, 3 to 5
minutes. Add seitan, pearl onions, and vegetable mixture to pot and
simmer, covered, 30 minutes.

Remove from heat and stir in parsley.

**Make topping while stew simmers:**

Peel (I washed) potatoes and cut into 2-inch pieces. Cover potatoes and
celery root with cold water in a 4-to 5-quart heavy pot, then simmer,
partially covered, until very tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup
cooking water, then drain in a colander.

Bring butter, milk, and cream to a simmer in pot over medium heat,
stirring until butter has melted. Stir in reserved cooking water, 1
teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Remove from heat. Force potatoes
and celery root through ricer into hot milk mixture and stir gently to
combine. (I just drained the potatoes, added spices and some milk, bob's
your uncle.)

**Finish pie:** I skipped this.

Preheat broiler. Put baking dish in a large 4-sided sheet pan and
transfer stew to dish.

Spoon potato mixture over stew and spread evenly to cover. Broil about 3
inches from heat until top is golden, about 5 minutes.
