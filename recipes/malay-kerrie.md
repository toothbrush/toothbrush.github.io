Ingredients

-   oil
-   4 onions, peeled and chopped
-   2-4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
-   1 piece fresh ginger, peeled and crushed
-   1 tablespoon cape malay curry powder or mild curry powder, of your
    choice
-   1 teaspoon ground coriander
-   1 teaspoon ground cumin
-   1/2 teaspoon tumeric
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   black pepper
-   1 cinnamon stick
-   3 cloves
-   2 bay leaves
-   2 **carrots**, peeled and diced
-   250 g dried **apricots**, soaked in warm water and drained (blik is
    makkelijker)
-   2 **bananas**, peeled and sliced
-   2 tablespoons tomato paste
-   50 ml wine vinegar
-   250 ml vegetable stock
-   3 tablespoons apricot **jam**
-   3 tablespoons natural **yoghurt**
-   enough rice

Directions
----------

1.  Heat the oil in a large pot or saucepan.
2.  Over high heat, fry the onions and garlic, stirring continuously.
    Add the ginger, curry powder and all the spices and continue
    stirring for a minute. Season to taste with pepper and add the salt.
3.  Reduce heat slightly. Add the meat/chick peas/other chewy thing and
    fry it until it is browned on all sides. (This may be easier if you
    remove the onions, garlic and ginger mixture and set them aside,
    then return them to the pot after the meat is browned.).
4.  Add the vinegar and stock, plus all the other remaining ingredients
    (except the apricot jam and yoghurt). Cover. Reduce heat. immer over
    a low heat, stirring occasionally, until everything is tender,
    approximately 1 1/2 hours for lamb and 2 hours for mutton, maybe a
    little longer.
5.  Stir in the apricot jam and the yoghurt a few minutes before
    serving.
6.  Serve this curry with yellow rice and a variety of sambals and
    atjars.
