Pretty simple fridge-cake-effort involving liquor. Yay. ![Pretty good
stuff.](Grasshopper-pie.jpg "fig:Pretty good stuff.")

Ingredients
===========

Base
----

-   200 odd grams of biscuits, eg Oreo, Bastogne, etc
-   2 ounces good quality bittersweet chocolate, chopped (or 1/4 cup
    chips) or cocoa powder
-   3 tablespoons soft unsalted butter, melted

Filling
-------

-   3 cups mini marshmallows
-   1/2 cup whole milk
-   1/4 cup creme de menthe
-   1/4 cup creme de cacao blanc
-   1 1/2 cups heavy cream
-   Few spots or drops green food coloring, optional
-   1 loose-bottomed 10-inch fluted tart pan, 2 inches deep

Method
======

1.  Save 1 cookie to crumble on top
2.  Food-processor-process the cookies/butter/cocoa, and press into the
    tart shape
3.  Place base in fridge.
4.  Melt marshmallows + milk over low heat, when the milk starts to
    foam, remove from heat and stir vigorously until the mixture is
    smooth.
5.  Let the mixture cool a bit, and whisk in the alcoholic stuff
6.  Whisk the cream until sort-of firm, don't make butter. !!!!
7.  Optional: whisk in some food colouring
8.  Add the cooled marshmallow mixture, all the while whisking.
9.  Stick the filling in the now-cool base and place in the fridge
    for \>4 hours.

Make-ahead notes
----------------

The pie can be made 1 to 2 days ahead. When chilled and firm, tent with
aluminum foil (try not to touch surface with foil as it will leave
marks) and store in the refrigerator. Decorate just before serving. The
pie will keep 3 to 4 days total.

Freeze Note:

The pie can be frozen for up to 3 months. Open-freeze undecorated pie
just until solid, then wrap the pie (still in its tart pan) in a double
layer of plastic wrap and a layer of foil. To thaw, unwrap the pie and
tent with foil (try not to touch surface with foil as it will leave
marks), then thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Decorate before
serving.
