Serves: 8

Ingredients
-----------

for the sauce:

-   1 x 15ml tablespoon garlic oil
-   1 onion, peeled and chopped
-   1 red pepper, de-seeded and chopped
-   2 green bird’s-eye chillies, chopped with seeds
-   1 teaspoon sea salt flakes or 1⁄2 teaspoon pouring salt
-   2 x 15ml tablespoons coriander stalks, finely chopped
-   2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes, plus 400ml water swilled from empty
    cans
-   1 x 15ml tablespoon tomato ketchup

for the filling:

-   2 x 400g cans black beans, drained and rinsed
-   2 x 250g cans (225g drained weight each) sweetcorn
-   250g mature goat’s Cheddar, grated, or cheese of your choice
-   1 packet (8) soft tortillas
-   1 x round ovenproof dish, approx. 26cm diameter x 6cm deep

Method
------

1.  Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6, slipping in a baking tray at
    the same time.
2.  To make the sauce, heat the oil in a pan on the stove and fry the
    onion, pepper and chilli. add the salt and cook gently for 15
    minutes and, once soft, add the chopped coriander stalks.
3.  Add the canned tomatoes, then swill the cans out with water and add
    this too. Spoon in the ketchup and let things come to a simmer,
    leaving the sauce (or salsa, in keeping with the Mexican mojo) to
    cook while you get on with preparing the filling – about 10 minutes.
4.  To make the filling, mix the drained beans and sweetcorn in a bowl.
    Add most of the grated cheese, reserving some to sprinkle on the top
    at the end, and mix together.
5.  Start to assemble the lasagne by spooning about a third of the salsa
    into the bottom of your ovenproof dish and smearing it about, then
    layer on 2 tortillas so that they cover the sauce overlapping
    slightly, like a Venn diagram.
6.  Add a third of the beans and cheese mixture, covering the tortillas,
    and then about a quarter of the remaining salsa and another 2
    tortillas.
7.  Repeat with another third of beans and cheese, and some more salsa
    before layering on another 2 tortillas.
8.  Finally, add the last layer of beans and cheese, nearly all of the
    remaining salsa and cover with the last 2 tortillas. Spread the very
    last bit of salsa over the tortillas and sprinkle with the remaining
    cheese.
9.  Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, and let it rest for a good 10–15
    minutes before slicing like a pizza, and eat with the avocado salsa
    opposite.
