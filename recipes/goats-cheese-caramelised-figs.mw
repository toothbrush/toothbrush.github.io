== Ingredients == 

* 1 tbsp olive oil (good stuff)
* 4 red onions, chopped
* 1 tsp rosemary
* 4+ dried figs
* 125ml bouillon
* 80ml white wine vinegar
* 45g brown sugar
* decadent salt & pepper
* 200g fettuccine (or tagliatelle), fresh preferably 
* 100g soft goats cheese
* more olive oil and/or parmesan cheese for garnishing

== Method ==

Combine oil, onion, rosemary, figs, bouillon, vinegar and sugar in a heavy pan and bring to the boil. Cover and allow to simmer for about 8-10 minutes, occasionally stirring.

When the onions are soft and caramelised, add salt and pepper to taste. In the meantime, boil pasta in ample, salted water. Once done, stir into onion mixture and serve in deep plates. Garnish with goats' cheese and decadent olive oil, optionally garnishing with a bit of Parmesan cheese.
