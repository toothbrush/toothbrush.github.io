Quick and easy yet tasty sauce, based on balsamic vinegar. Looks decadent.

* 1 part balsamic vinegar
* 1 part honey
* thyme (of course fresh if possible)
* possibly some black pepper

Method:

* boil the honey mixed up with the thyme for a short while (±3 minutes?)
* let the honey sit for quite a while (±30 minutes)
* reheat the lot, add the vinegar
* boil until reduced to ±1/3 of original volume
* let mixture cool down (important, otherwise it remains watery)
