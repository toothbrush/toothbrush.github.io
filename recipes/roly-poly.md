Note: dough seemed too buttery as it was rather sticky and all the jam
escaped quite fast. Also, watch out with the salt.

tiny pudding:
-------------

-   jam (apricot)
-   1 cup flour (+/- 125g or a little more)
-   125g butter
-   .5 tsp baking powder
-   water and salt

1.  preheat oven to 190deg C
2.  grease dish
3.  rub butter into dry ingredients (preferably with fork/fingertips, so
    butter doesn't melt)
4.  take drops of water to bind the mixture
5.  roll out pastry (possibly after "resting")
6.  brush edges with water
7.  spread jam in the middle
8.  bake until light golden brown (20-30 minutes)

sauce:
------

-   alcohol
-   .5 cup sugar (100g)
-   1 cup water (in fact I used about 100ml and it was almost too runny
    (as a result of too much booze/too little thickener?))
-   pinch salt
-   cinnamon stick/teaspoon ground cinnamon

1.  boil the lot up and thicken with say a heaped teaspoon of flour
    blended with a little milk (no lumps!)
2.  (while the sugar and water is boiling stir in the thickener)
3.  take off the heat and add either dessert wine/OBS or brandy (whisky
    might work too)
