Ingredients
-----------

-   olive oil
-   garlic
-   basil stalks
-   pine nuts
-   tomato paste
-   red wine
-   salt pepper
-   brown sugar
-   mushrooms
-   lemon juice
-   red wine vinegar
-   cream
-   parmesan
-   basil leaves

Method
------

Dry-fry your pines nuts to release the flavour.

Chop up the garlic and basil stalks and fry lightly in oil for a minute
or two until soft.

Add dry-fried pine nuts.

Add tomato paste and reduce.

Add the red wine boil for ages until it's completely reduced and you
have very winey oil.

Add salt, pepper, brown sugar and mushrooms. Stir until the mushrooms
have absorbed the oil, then released it along with their own mushroom
waters.

Add lemon juice and red wine vinegar. Cook for a bit. You want the
moisture to evaporate and boil away so that the winey mushroom mix ix
thick.

Turn off the heat and let cool for five min, then add the cream. If you
put the cream in whilst it's too hot, the cream will curdle.

Stir in the grated parmesan and basil leaves.

Bring up to heat again on a low heat, stirring so that the cheese does
not catch on the bottom of the pan.

Tips - add sun dried tomatoes and chilli for a more intense version.
