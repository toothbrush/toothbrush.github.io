This stuff was really good! Kind of like a cross between jam and ketchup
and chutney.

Original recipe was for 5 pounds, approx 2.5kg tomatoes. Yield this time
was 1 jar (±350ml).

Ingredients
-----------

-   500g tomatoes, finely chopped
-   175g sugar
-   1.5 tablespoons lime juice
-   2/5 teaspoons freshly grated ginger
-   1/5 teaspoon cinnamon
-   1/10 teaspoon ground cloves
-   1/5 tablespoon salt
-   1 dried chilli, chopped
