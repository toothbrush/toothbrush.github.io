This is https://www.denknerd.org.

It has been through a few iterations: using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), then a bunch of homemade shell scripts around the awesome [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), but after finding myself reimplementing most of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and realising it'd be easiest to just use that on Github Pages which has builtin support for all the things i need.. sigh.
